    info: Lead Developer
    date: December 2014 - Present
    description: "Since Tribeswell is a Wordpress shop, I have gained expertise in turning a basic Wordpress installation into a fully responsive website. I learned Angular 1 from building a hybrid mobile app on the Ionic Framework with Firebase as a backend. I also perform weekly and monthly server maintenance tasks to ensure uptime for all hosted sites and I wrote a script to automate this process."

    description: "Working with Javascript is my favorite. I learned Angular through building the Necter app with the Ionic framework. I'm currently learning and building apps with Meteor. I plan to start working with React and learning more about Node. I've started to use Underscore since working with Meteor, but I've heard better things of Lodash so I plan to incorporate that into my workflow."

    info: "Sass, CSS3"
    description: "I picked up Sass early on when I first started learning web development. Nesting rules is much more intuitive and easier to read and write with. I've recently been interested in Stylus so I can get rid of those pesky braces."
