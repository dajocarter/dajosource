  - title: Javascript
    info: Angular JS, Meteor JS, Node JS, React JS, jQuery
    description: Working with Javascript is my favorite. I learned Angular through building the Necter app with the Ionic framework. I'm currently learning and building apps with Meteor. I plan to start working with React and learning more about Node. I've started to use Underscore since working with Meteor, but I've heard better things of Lodash so I plan to incorporate that into my workflow.

    info: Sass, CSS3
    description: I picked up Sass early on when I first started learning web development. Nesting rules is much more intuitive and easier to read and write with. I've recently been interested in Stylus so I can get rid of those pesky braces.
